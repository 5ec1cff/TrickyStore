# Tricky Store

A trick of keystore. **Android 12 or above is required**.

## Usage

1. Flash this module and reboot.  
2. Put keybox.xml to /data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml .  
3. Put target packages to /data/adb/tricky_store/target.txt (Optional).  
4. Enjoy!  

## keybox.xml

format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<AndroidAttestation>
    <NumberOfKeyboxes>1</NumberOfKeyboxes>
    <Keybox DeviceID="...">
        <Key algorithm="ecdsa|rsa">
            <PrivateKey format="pem">
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
            </PrivateKey>
            <CertificateChain>
                <NumberOfCertificates>...</NumberOfCertificates>
                    <Certificate format="pem">
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
                    </Certificate>
                ... more certificates
            </CertificateChain>
        </Key>...
    </Keybox>
</AndroidAttestation>
```

## Build Vars Spoofing

> **Zygisk (or Zygisk Next) is needed for this feature to work.**

If you can not pass strong integrity, you can try to enable build vars spoofing
by creating a file `/data/adb/tricky_store/spoof_build_vars`.

After doing that, TrickyStore will automatically generate an example config json
inside `/data/adb/tricky_store/spoof_build_vars` on next reboot. Then you can manually
edit your spoof config.

Here is an example of spoof config:

```
MANUFACTURER=Google
MODEL=Pixel
FINGERPRINT=google/sailfish/sailfish:8.1.0/OPM1.171019.011/4448085:user/release-keys
BRAND=google
PRODUCT=sailfish
DEVICE=sailfish
RELEASE=8.1.0
ID=OPM1.171019.011
INCREMENTAL=4448085
TYPE=user
TAGS=release-keys
SECURITY_PATCH=2017-12-05
```

## Support TEE broken devices

TrickyStore will hack leaf certificate by default.
On TEE broken devices, this will not work because we can't retrieve leaf certificate from TEE.
You can add a `!` after package name to enable certificate generate support for this package.

For example:

```
# target.txt
# use leaf certificate hacking mode for KeyAttestation App
io.github.vvb2060.keyattestation
# use certificate generating mode for gms
com.google.android.gms!
```

## Known issue

- App Attest Key is not supported.
- StrongBox is not supported.
